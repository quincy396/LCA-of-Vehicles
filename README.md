# LCA-of-Vehicles
Code for my project Life-Cycle Assessment of Fuel Shift in the Bay Area.
The code uses historical data of the age of each vehicle in the Bay Area. Then it creates a smoothed model of average age of vehicles on the road. It also creates the split of electric vehicle vs non-electric vehicle for each year.
Then it uses the CA predicted EV sales numbers for each year up to 2030, to find the number of electric vs non-electric vehicles will be on the road in 2030.
